Title: Still I Rise
Author: MAYA ANGELOU

1. You may write me down in history
2. With your bitter, twisted lies,
3. You may trod me in the very dirt
4. But still, like dust, I'll rise.

5. Does my sassiness upset you?
6. Why are you beset with gloom?
7. â€™Cause I walk like I've got oil wells

9. Just like moons and like suns,
10. With the certainty of tides,
11. Just like hopes springing high,
12. Still I'll rise.
